      TODO review following configuration based on your action. Do you require and support concurrency? Which retry policy do you require? ...

      'defaultPartitions' cannot be changed without deleting the topic on Kafka side, meaning it's important to configure it properly before its creation (first deployment) if you want to have concurrent processing,
      as it limits the number of concurrent threads

      'defaultConcurrency' limits the number of threads to start. Following rule must be true: defaultConcurrency <= defaultPartitions

      It is always interesting to leave some room if you need to increase the concurrency in the future, for instance having defaultConcurrency="2" defaultPartitions ="4"
      A factor 3 could be interesting.

      1 1 is needed when you need to have an order
